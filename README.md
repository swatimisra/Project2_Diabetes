# Project2_Diabetes

This project uses a dataset of common Diabetes-related variables to analyze the relationship between the variables and the presence of diabetes. This project requires the dplyr and ggplot2 libraries in order to complete the analysis. The dataset was retrieved off Kaggle and cleaned/reshaped using R functions. 

Project2.Rmd is the RMarkdown file with all code, comments, and conclusions typed. 

Project2.html is the html file that contains the final report for the project. 

diabetes.png is the picture file for the picture linked in the RMarkdown and the html file.

diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv is the .csv file that contains all data values before I cleaned and reshaped them.
